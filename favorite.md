I prefer nano, although emacs is a close second. If emacs had a help bar with common commands, then it would be my favorite. If I was more familiar with the commands of emacs, it would become my favorite. For now, with my limited experience with the editors, nano is my favorite. I think it is easier for people who have never used a command line text editor before. I found vi to be considerably more difficult. I think what was the most confusing about that was the fact that some of the commands did not require pressing ctrl or esc first.
